⚠️ Transparency: N (Novelty), C (Constraint), and L (Cognitive Load) are human-interpreted metrics designed to visualize patterns in LLM outputs. They do not imply reasoning, cognition, or agency inside the model.

Measurable Basis: These metrics are paired with perplexity and attention entropy across turns, so observations are quantifiable and reproducible, not speculative.

Reproducibility: All code and synthetic datasets are included in this repo for verification. Users can run simulations and compare patterns directly.

Purpose: The framework highlights structural dynamics under sustained, high-directional prompts — token prediction behavior under constraint accumulation in sparse training regions. It’s meant as a practical, falsifiable benchmark, not a claim of emergent reasoning.
